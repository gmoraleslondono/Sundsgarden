### To create a React project
- ```npm create vite@latest```

In a full-stack project create 2 folder client and server, run the previous command on the client folder

- ```.editorconfig``` file (set this file at the root of your project if the formatting rules for both the frontend and backend are the same or largely consistent. This keeps the project organized and ensures that all collaborators follow the same coding style across the entire project.)

```
root = true


[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = lf
charset = utf-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
