### What to think when starting a new project?
- Who is this project for? Build an understanding of their needs, ask question, and ask questions
- Break it down on smaller tasks (user stories): what is the most important to start with and build your MVP (minimal viable product) don’t think about how it looks it will be fixed later. Once you have a MVP show it to the client (hear feedback)
- Make a design first: Don’t start coding without a prototype (Figma or Balsamiq). Show it to the client (hear feedback)
- Choose the language to build your app (there is not right or wrong)
- Use Redux as state management tool, manage your variables across the project
- Don’t procrastinate, get started and check with the client regularly
- Use modules
- Use semantic elements
- Get good in one language, not have some knowledge about a lot
- Don’t repeat yourself and reuse
- Don’t over do/work the project (remember the MVP)
